- IaaS(Compute Engine), PaaS(App Engine)
- Security
    - hardware infrastructure level
    - service deployment level: encrypts all RPC traffic
    - user identity level
    - storage service level
    - internet communication level: GFE - TLS connections using correct certificates, DoS protection
    - operational security level
- Basic IAM role > Predefined IAM role > Custom IAM role

- Storage
    - cloud storage, bigtable, cloudSQL, spanner, Firestore
    - standard(hot) < nearline < coldline < archive
- Kubernetes, GKE
- Cloud Run, Cloud Run functions
- Prompt Engineering
    - generative ai: generating various types of content
    - large language model: focusing on language tasks - calculates the probability of the correct answer from pre-trained model.
    - hallucinations: nonsensical or grammatically incorrect
    - zero-shot, one-shot(provide one example), few-shot, role prompt(i want you to act as..)
